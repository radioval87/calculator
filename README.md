# calculator
A calculator. One of my training projects. I thought that it would be both educational and entertaining to create such project and it was. I used Javascript, HTML, some CSS and Flask. Although it wasn't really necessary to use Python, it's the main language that I study, so I connected Javascript front-end with Flask. It lacks some functionality but I had no intentions of re-inventing a calculator.

To run this project on your local machine, you may use Docker with 
```bash
'make build'  
'make run'  
```
